PLAN FOR SERVER-WIDE FILE LOGGING

1. Introduce a central logger utility that writes structured entries to log.txt with timestamps and context helpers (info/warn/error + SQL helper).
2. Replace existing console logging in controllers, middleware, and scripts with calls to the logger so every "data accepted" and "data sent" event is captured.
3. Instrument the database layer to log every SQL command and its outcome, including durations and errors.
4. Add Express middleware hooks to log request/response metadata (method, path, status, request id/user) so flows stay traceable.
5. Ensure log.txt rotates or truncates safely later; for now keep append-only access with file locking safeguards if concurrency becomes a concern.
