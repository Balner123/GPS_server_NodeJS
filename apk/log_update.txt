- Handshake now executes without requiring a session cookie; Cookie header is attached only when present (HandshakeManager.kt).
- Telemetry (SyncWorker.kt) no longer skips batches when the cookie is missing, conditionally sets the Cookie header, and filters optional fields to meet validator ranges (e.g., accuracy >= 0).
- TURN_OFF parity: LocationService listens for a local STOP broadcast so PowerController can stop the foreground service just like the manual toggle, ensuring the service actually shuts down and reports OFF state.
